# Comparison Of User behaviour Analysis Software

This repository has been created for AUGMENTED AND VIRTUAL REALITY course. Our Project is about "Comparison of user behaviour analysis software"

- Under the supervision of Matteo Scaramuzzino
- [Authors](AUTHORS.md)

Our objective will be to analyse different software that deals with recording user behaviour and actions within a VR Unreal Engine project, evaluating the pros and cons of the various software. 



## Part 1: What do we need to analyse?

- Where and under what conditions framerate drops occur.<br>
- Collisions on the route, any passing difficulties, and problems following the route.<br>
- What are the most visited and least visited places on the map?<br>
- How much time users spend in the various levels?<br>
- How much time users spend in the tutorial, and how many people use it?<br>
- How many users finish the tutorial, and where they stop?<br>
- If the software is compatible with virtual reality projects?<br>
